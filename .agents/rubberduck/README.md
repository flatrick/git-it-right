# Rubber-duck findings

Stored output of the `/rubberduck` skill — an adversarial-by-default brainstorming partner that disagrees,
hunts holes in an idea, then suggests improvements.
These files are **not** designs, specs, plans, tickets, or a commitment to build anything;
they only record what was found.

## Layout

`<topic-slug>/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS>.md` — a topic is a directory, a session is one file inside it.

One file per session, never appended to.
That is what keeps parallel work merge-clean:
two sessions on the same topic in different git branches write *different* files,
so git merges them without conflict.
The only way to collide is two saves in the same clock second under the same slug,
which human-paced use makes negligible.

Read a topic's thread by reading its directory's files in filename (chronological) order.
Each file is self-contained — no cross-file titles, no continuation.

## Slugs are labels, not identifiers

The same topic can legitimately end up under two slugs.
A session can only see the topic directories in its own checkout,
so a matching topic worked on in another git branch is invisible until merge,
and `cache-design/` and `caching-layer/` both get created.
A case-only difference (`cache-design` vs `Cache-Design`) is a separate directory in git but collides on Windows and macOS filesystems.

So: **find a topic's material by searching file contents, not by trusting the directory name.**

To reconcile duplicate directories,
move the files on a quiet branch — a concurrent session still writing to the old directory will resurrect it and need a second pass.
